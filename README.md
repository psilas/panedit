A Vim Bundle for using John MacFarlane's superb [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for everyday writing. This bundle owes a huge amount to David Sanson's excellent (and much more comprehensive [Vim-Pandoc](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc)), and was developed primarily for my own specific needs.
